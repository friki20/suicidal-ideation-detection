BERT-based classification for suicidal vs non-suicidal texts
# Suicidal Ideation Detection

This repository contains the code used in the paper:
**"High-Performance Suicide Ideation Detection Using a Transformer-Based Architecture"**

## ðŸ“Œ Description
The project explores **automatic detection of suicidal ideation** from social media texts using a transformer-based model (**BERT**).  
The notebook provided includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Fine-tuning BERT for binary classification (suicidal vs non-suicidal)
- Evaluation with metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Numpy

## Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook 98-suicidal-and-non-suicidal-classification.ipynb
